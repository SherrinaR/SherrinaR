## 👋 Hello!
I'm Sherrina, a full-stack engineer in the USA. I like combining my technical knowledge with design to make beautiful and dynamic applications. My goal is to build scalable and efficient software while providing engaging user experiences.

Outside of software development, I like 
- going to tech conferences that offer current industry knowledge and professional development
- music & food festivals
- reading
- anime and manga
